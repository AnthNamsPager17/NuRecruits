    <h1>Marketing Campaign Development</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Marketing Video</h2>
    <p>A crucial aspect to this project is the sourcing of funding and legislative approval. Without the backing of Government, no drones will take flight, no medical supplies will be delivered, and no lives will be saved. Our plan to tackle this decisive element is the production of a concise but impactful video that will persuade the necessary stakeholders to support the project.</p>

    <p>This video will consist of five elements:</p>

      <ol>
          <li>An interview with the CEO of <nu>recruITs, outlining the aim and motivation of the project. This will demonstrate the passion and capability of the team and inspire confidence amongst investors that we will be able to deliver on the technical and engineering fundamentals behind our vision.</li>

          <li>A cartoon animation that outlines the base case study of how drones are faster than ambulances at arriving at a person's home in the event of a cardiac arrest, and how this difference in time is the difference between life and death. The animation will be content rich, allowing the viewer to absorb the vital statistics behind the justification of the project. The simplistic visuals will clarify the message for easy comprehension.</li>

          <li>One or two hypothetical news reports that demonstrate real world scenarios and highlight the advantages of the project. This will be a highly impactful segment, taking the project from the theoretical to the real world. When a stakeholder can visualise the benefit for the community, they are more likely to offer support.</li>

          <li>An update of development progress so far, featuring footage and photographs of drone flights, programming, and the mobile application. This will demonstrate our competence and innovation across the full spectrum of the project's requirements and convince stakeholders that we have the drive and ability to see this project to successful completion.</li>

          <li>Introduction to the team. Each member will be quickly introduced alongside their role within the project. This will establish a relationship between the team and the potential investors and give them confidence in the diversity of skills, interests, and personalities within the team.</li>
      </ol>

    <p>This plan took us some time to come up with, as we realised the importance of the video being short and powerful. We had to scrap other ideas of content to include that would take away from the main aim of the video to convince investors of the legitimacy and impact of the project in order to induce financial support.</p>

    <p>One of the great challenges with this video will be keeping all five elements within the timeframe allotted to them. This will require detailed scripting so that every word counts, along with careful rehearsal and video editing to ensure each second of video makes maximum impact.</p>

    <p>We are unfamiliar with animation processes and technology but have a vision for the success of the final outcome of this crucial aspect to the video. We are confident we will be able to source the required software, and with concerted effort will be able to produce content to the professional standard that we expect of ourselves.</p>

    <p>After the planning meeting, we had great success creating an animation using the beginner coding platform Scratch from MIT. The end result is exactly what we hoped for and perfectly demonstrates the key benefit of this technology over the current technology. We believe that this section of the marketing video will be particularly impactful on any visual learners in the audience. It also balances the video well, offering an alternative to the more serious and voice-over intensive sections. We were surprised at how easily this section was able to be accomplished. Had we chosen to use hand-drawn illustrations in an animation this would have been far more labour intensive. Using scratch was efficient and effective, and complemented our burgeoning programming skills by consolidating the concepts about programming logic and reasoning.</p>

    <p>Sound effects were added to the animation using iMovie, including an upbeat corporate backing track, ambient traffic and car sounds, the drone sound, and the ambulance siren. These greatly enhanced the impact of the animation, and will ensure that it is an effective and unique component of the marketing video.</p>

    <p>The script for the news report was written soon after the planning meeting occurred. Some research into news report writing was conducted to help influence the wording. It was based upon a scenario that had previously been written about the potential uses of this technology. This script now needs plenty of rehearsal to ensure speedy and accurate delivery, and then filming and editing can occur.</p>

    <p>The final week involved filming for the promotional video. This presented numerous challenges to amateur videographers without professional equipment or software. This was particularly apparent in capturing high quality audio, but we also faced challenges when trying to recreate a studio, as well as with filming outdoors during lockdown or inclement weather. We attempted to film the video and overlay separate audio but quickly realised that synching these was beyond our production capacity. We experimented with different microphones. In the end we had to lower our expectations and understand that professional audio was not within the scope and limitations at this point in the timeline of the project. Dedicated rehearsal to ensure smooth and confident delivery, combined with multiple takes and some background noise reduction software produced an outcome that we were content with.</p>

    <h2>Researching Government Contracts</h2>

    <p>As part of the marketing team, it is our job to research and investigate ways in which <nu>recruITs can market our product and what the best way is for us to do so in a start up situation. We started off by investigating government contracts and how they are offered, before moving onto a more realistic approach in a go-fund me.</p>

    <p>To get a government contract you need to tailor what you are doing to something the government is already offering as a contract. You then apply for that contract and if you get it, then you are free to go ahead. You can not simply apply to get a contract tailored to you, or ask the government to fund you. The easiest way to get funded, is to pitch your idea to big pharmaceutical companies who already have access to the medical equipment we need, such as epi pens, defibrillator and first aid kits. Another simpler way is to create a go-fund-me under a non-for-profit banner, with the aim to start for low funding and increase it over time with the end goal still being that a government agency will contract us to continue to develop and produce our product but under a different banner suited to their needs. The perks of a go-fund-me is we are not restricted by a government agency, however the perks the government brings can help us “skirt” some laws that they have place. If we get funded by a pharmaceutical company nothing is stopping them from taking over and producing our product by themselves.</p>

    <p>Brewdog is company that brews beer and sells it on a international scale. They receive crowd funding. However there pitch is that they will stay independent and not be brought out by larger companies. This is something that equates to the average person. Brew Dog would give people who help crowd fund there project a $100 stake in the company.  Crowd funders do get a stake in the business however they do have a say in how the business operates and instead receive perks such as invites to their yearly AGM’s, Free beers on your birthday and discounts when buying products from the brewdog shop. You have zero voting rights its more like you share in the company is symbolic. The crowd funders love this idea and embrace it, because of this, Brewdog see’s these people as free advertising, embraces them and welcomes them into the “Punk” family.</p>

    <p>In summary the best way for <nurecruIT’s> to get going would be to create a go-fund me. By doing a go-fund me as a non-for profit company we are then able to develop our product in our own time with no set deadlines. In saying this there will need to be dead lines available for our crowd funding to continue, so the people investing money will have something to see what they built. A way to get the funders involved in the idea would be to keep them update about every time our drones helped save a life. Every time we save a life, means through there help we are able to prolong and save human lives. This means they helped save a life and we should celebrate this. Another way to get the community involved would be allowing them to use our code on their drones and submit any feedback they have. Give them beta accesses to our apps and websites making them the first people who can help pioneer the change we are trying to make.</p>

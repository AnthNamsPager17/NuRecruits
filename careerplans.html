<h1>Career Plans</h1>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Bradley Pavey</h2>
<p>Brad’s ideal job is a cyber security analyst. Brad plans to study online at a university level with cyber security and networking be an integral part in the elective subjects. He wishes to gain experience from the Australian Signals Decorate (or ASD - https://www.asd.gov.au/ ) by completing a cadet or internship while studying at university. It is his intention that by completing this internship/cadet program that he will learn firsthand about cyber security analysts by physically learning on the job through this program.</p>
<p>Brad currently only has a certificate III in Media which was completed in 2014 during schooling. The certificate III is more tailored to gaming and making character designs which will not help in achieving the goals of a cyber security analyst. Brad has extensive knowledge in how to learn by self-troubleshoot throughout his years as a retail manager and by building several computers for himself and people within his inner circle.</p>

<h2>Lachlan Jensen</h2>
<p>Lachlan’s ideal job is to become a Network Engineer. His ideal profession has remained the same throughout the duration of this course and his drive to achieve his goals is only increasing. The career plan that will enable Lachlan to become a network engineer involves goals such as completing a degree in Information Technology, completing CCNA R&S certification, gaining experience working at a Managed Service Provider (MSP) and overall building a vast set of skills across all fields of information technology. Lachlan’s career plan shares many similarities to other career plans within his group, such as Jeremy Baker’s plan to become a cloud engineer and Anthony Namroud’s plan to become a cybersecurity engineer. Network engineer, Cloud engineer, and Cybersecurity engineer are all positions that require an extensive level of networking knowledge and experience. The paths to achieve each of these career goals share many similarities, such as all career plans beginning with earning a degree in IT and all of them requiring many years of experience working in the field of networking or at an MSP. Since the journey to achieve these goals share so many similarities it shows that the skills, we develop for our ideal job can be useful across many different professions, not just the one we plan for now, allowing our ideal jobs to evolve over time and adapt to the everchanging IT landscape.
</p>
<h2>Nicholas Richards</h2>
<p>Nicholas' ideal job remains a data and evaluation lead at a non-profit organisation. I am even more passionate about using data and machine learning to build convincing presentations and business cases.</p>
<p>I am confident in the career plan I have developed, featuring gradual exposure to more senior leadership positions within the project management team of data analysis. The Bachelor of IT will be the perfect starting platform, with some supplementary study in statistics to ensure I have the required comprehensive understanding of data.</p>
<p>This course has provided a good groundwork for presentation skills. I am looking forward to making an impact in the presentation of our Group IT Project. Marketing, persuasion, and manufacturing compelling arguments are skills I have and desire to implement.</p>
<p>This career is a standout in our group, as it stands in the convergence of information technology with stakeholders, both technical and non-technical, decision makers and users. This highlights the diverse range of careers available in the IT industry, and the importance of soft skills to secure many of these roles.</p>
<p>As such it has a lower technical knowledge requirement than many other careers chosen by the group, but a greater demand for presentation and project management skills.</p>

<h2>Jeremy Baker</h2>
<p>My ideal job is still very much undecided, there are quite a lot of different career paths, and the industry is evolving with the technology. At this early stage if I could tentatively commit to an area, it would be to get in on the ground floor with a large, profitable, established enterprise with a well-known brand. One Seek job advertisement that piqued my interest was the reserve bank of Australia’s graduate development program in information technology.  I would think this would require very high grades and endorsements to obtain a position like this, however. I think that many other companies would be offering similar roles and I believe that in the months before graduation their existence is made aware to graduating classes.
</p>
<p>I am an older student, and this may lead me to become a more attractive proposition for a less cutting-edge position where my duties may not require reinventing the wheel as much as aiding in keeping it turning. This could involve transitioning a business to implement a cloud computing via virtual machines, which I am quite interested in and believe can provide small businesses with many options and solutions to their computing needs. To summarize my ideal job will be something I enjoy, gives me purpose and satisfaction while hurting none.</p>

<h2>Anthony Namroud</h2>
<p>Common elements found in six of the ideal jobs listed in our group’s skillsets, show a networking nature for maintenance, protection, quality control, programming trends and cost effectiveness for all business networks. Although I wish to become a Cyber Security Engineer, these elements show there is a definite need to expand my skillsets towards Network Engineering and Cloud Engineering.</p>
<p>The differences between Cyber Security Engineers, Networking Engineers and Cloud Engineers shows that there is a requirement for more data analysis, technical skills, and a display of level of demand is higher than cyber security engineering regarding career opportunities.</p>
<p>Cyber Security Engineers have a broader spectrum towards network, data protection, and a “high level of computer forensic competence (Degree, 2021)” for businesses, public users, and government departments to help against the fight of cybercrime. Some careers range from a more competitive nature, such as Video Game Developers and Cloud Engineers, while other careers require a more complex understanding of their job requirements, such as Network Engineers, and Software Engineers. My career plans have shown me that I need to expand my knowledge base into other skillsets to better combine the need for protection and development in software and technological design. To better progress in my career I have decided to further my studies in Network Engineering in Computer and Technology, and Cloud Engineering.</p>

<h2>Jacob Brakespeare</h2>
<p>Jacobs Ideal job was previously stated to be a video game developer, however after further research into the field of IT, the ideal job position evolved towards Specialist Software Engineer </p>
<p>I have made the choice towards pursuing software engineer as it was a more focused position within my original desired field of employment, game development. But specified itself to positions I felt I could enjoy and perform well.</p>
<p>A software engineers help in the construction and Development of computer system’s software and applications software, like performing modifications and maintenance the necessary software, usually through the use of at least one programming language they specialise in.</p>
<p>The necessary career path would start with my completion of a bachelor’s degree in information technology, and a bachelor’s degree in programming, with a specialisation in the C++ programming language, as well working in the employ of a junior software engineer position, then following with the natural progression path to software engineer and senior software engineer </p>

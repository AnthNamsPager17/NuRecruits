    <h1>Roles</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Nicholas Richards’ Role – Data Analyst and Marketing Assistant</h2>

    <p>I have been assigned the job title Data Analyst and Marketing Assistant. This role entails the creation of 6-8 detailed and compelling case studies that will support the business objectives of our IT Project. The case studies will demonstrate the overwhelming benefits of drone delivery of life saving equipment using real world or realistic hypothetical scenarios. They will need to include comparative mapping, analysis with calculated current response times, and an in-depth analysis of this raw data to provide insights to inform decision making regarding the viability of the project. </p>
    <p>This data will be fed into our marketing plan to present to government and/or industry in order to secure funding for infrastructure as well as policy and licensing approval. I will be responsible for collecting the data, instigating the case studies, undertaking analysis, and presentation of useful insights utilising visual and auditory presentation aids and communication skills.</p>

    <h2>Bradley Pavey’s Role – Project Manager</h2>
    <p>“In the broadest sense, project managers (PMs) are responsible for planning, organizing, and directing the completion of specific projects for an organization while ensuring these projects are on time, on budget, and within scope.” (Kelsey Miller, 2019) During this project I will be organising all group meetings, taking notes, setting agendas and ensure that meetings are set up so our deadlines are met. I will be organising the timeframe section of this project; this will include the 6 weeks that we have for it and what we could accomplish if we did an extra 10 weeks as well.  I will also help in marketing by creating an ad that is tailored to government agencies, in addition to working on our presentation for our assignment.</p>


    <h2>Lachlan Jensen’s Role – Software Development</h2>
    <p>Within the nuRecruITs group, Lachlan’s has been assigned a role in the software development team where he will develop python code to control a drone, using his existing skills as well as skills he develops throughout the duration of the project. Lachlan has also overseen the development of our team pdf document and has aimed to make the compilation of all team members work as smooth as possible. </p>
    <p>Some tasks that Lachlan’s roles require are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Researching the python language</li>
          <li>Teaching other team members about programming in python</li>
          <li>Researching drone hardware</li>
          <li>Researching drone physics</li>
          <li>Designing a program based on team requirements</li>
          <li>Developing a program to meet requirements</li>
          <li>Testing and debugging code</li>
          <li>Presenting and explaining developments to the team</li>
          <li>Developing a template for the final PDF</li>
          <li>Coordinating updates and additions to PDF</li>
          <li>Reviewing PDF contributions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Anthony Namroud’s Role – Application/Website Development</h2>
      <p>The role delegated to me was leading the Website Development. My role was mainly aimed at developing the website and fixing code issues in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files, and the implementation of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and consisted of using tools such as GitHub Desktop, GitHub Repositories, use of different browsers and Atom to help with the progress of the development. This role helps to promote our product through web site design, information, and user interface, by providing specifics to our end goals as a group. My role could require me to look further into other primary sources of information to connect to our app, and apply extra features like access through a website, and the use of fingerprint scanners or facial recognition to make it more user friendly, and secure across all devices. Changes to my role will also consist of testing our product to provide a status of development into its success, using video footage of a drone programmed to do as it needs to, and proof of its maximum carrying capacity to fulfill emergency requirements upon its delivery to the scene. My role will change between App Development, Web Site Development and Product Testing on a weekly basis.</p>


      <h2>Jacob Brakespeare’s Role – Software Development</h2>
      <p>Jacob has been allocated with software development. He will be required to learn the necessary basics to python programming in order to help construct the code needed for the operation of our test drone. He also has taken the duty of producing our risk and assessment section along with the comparison between the desired professions amongst the group. his software development position in this assignment will also require Jacob to understand the limitations and possibilities and restrictions of the drone technology used in this endeavour, and to translate this knowledge into an understandable analysis of our efforts</p>

      <h2>Jeremy Baker’s Role – Application/Website Development</h2>
      <p>My work currently is primarily concerned with the front end of the assignment. Working with Anthony we will develop a mobile phone app and a website. The mobile app will use a graphic user interface (GUI) and will be optimised for simplicity and ease of use. To enable this, I will have to gain an understanding of the GUI concept and its applications. Learning how to use Kivy software to compliment Python programming will be essential to realise my project. My imagination and insights are also contributing to the group, as are everybody's, and while occasionally getting a little off track thinking aloud is an especially useful tool in group work. I expect my role to evolve, and I will review my teammates work and offer any critiques or information that could improve our project and expect the same from them.</p>

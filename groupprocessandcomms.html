    <p>Communication will primarily be via twice weekly video conferences between all 6 members of the <nu>recruITs team. These will be 40-60 minutes in duration, and will feature an agenda with time allocation for each agenda item. In particular each member will be given up to 5 minutes to update the team on their progress and future plans for their portion of the assigned work. </p>
    <p>These meetings will be supplemented with text chat within MIcrosoft Teams. We will also break the team down into subgroups of 2 members to focus on specific areas within the project. These subgroups will communicate via MS Teams chat as well as video conferencing as required for brainstorming, troubleshooting, collaboration and progress reports. </p>
    <p>We introduced a better system for managing task allocation and the tracking of deadlines and completed tasks. These were initially managed using Kanban to great effect, but this required a subscription, so we quickly pivoted to Microsoft ToDo, within the Microsoft Teams platform, with minimal disruption. This proved to be an excellent tool to clearly visualise the due date and people assigned for various tasks, as well as the current progress for each task. Members were able to manipulate this to demonstrate the outcomes they had achieved in between meetings. Seeing the progress of team members was motivating for others to contribute and not fall behind in their deadlines.  </p>
    <p>At the mid-point of this assessment we had experienced few instances of unresponsive teammates, but when we did we usually had success by reaching out through multiple communication channels, including MS Teams chat and RMIT email. In the final weeks one team member withdrew, missing video conferences, not responding to direct communication, and not contributing or collaborating on their assigned work. Fortunately it was still two weeks before the deadline so we were able to anticipate taking on their workload if the lack of communication continued. It did put considerable pressure on their partner in the mini-group, and this concern was voiced at one video conference. This person was offered additional support by two group members who felt they were able to offer assistance. It was postulated that the reason behind the withdrawal by this team member was that they did not approve of our IT Project idea, and were therefore unmotivated to participate in it. This was bemusing for us as a team because we felt that the project had allowed us all to pursue any and all avenues of IT interest that we had. The rest of us felt real autonomy over our involvement in the project, whether it was our idea or not. Given that this had been our direction since early in the process of completing Assignment 2, there had also been ample opportunity for this team member to switch to a group that was pursuing an IT project more to their liking. </p>
    <p>MS Teams chats proved to be excellent for assisting people who may have needed assistance. Anthony, in his role as Chief Web Developer, uploaded a video of himself demonstrating how to access the team's GitHub repository and clone it for local access. This was an excellent and timely resource for those of us who still lacked confidence with some aspects of GitHub. Brad was able to ask for assistance with the production of the video for marketing purposes, which triggered a productive video conference with Nick in which that aspect was given good direction and some solid ideas were outlined. Lachlan and Jacob liaised together on the programming artifacts for drone flight controls. Lachlan was able to tutor Jacob in Python to help him gain understanding of the goals of their sub-group. </p>
    <p>Roughly half way through the work period Jacob was struggling to complete the work that he had been allocated, and it was affecting his ability to complete any of the work on time because he felt so overwhelmed. Meanwhile Lachlan was surging through his workload and had completed all his written content by this same time. Jacob was brave enough to put his hand up and request help, and Lachlan was generous enough to offer to take a portion of his workload off him. This cooperation, vulnerability and generosity boosted morale across the team and everyone put in extra effort knowing that our team cultivated such a supportive environment.  </p>
    <p>In the final weeks Brad was juggling many different tasks, from leading all the group processes, meetings and timeframes, to being production manager on the marketing video. For his task of outlining the timeframe for the group he was required to produce a functional Excel spreadsheet. Brad realised his Excel skills were rusty and a refresher course would take hours to get him up to speed. He recalled from previous team chats that Anthony was proficient and enthusiastic in Excel and reached out to him for assistance. Following this meeting Anthony was able to format the spreadsheet to Brad's requirements in a very short period of time. </p>

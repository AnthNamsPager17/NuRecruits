<p>My time spent with the nuRecruITs team has been a massive personal learning experience. Before beginning the assessment, I was unsure how I would perform in a group environment as I most commonly work individually. During the timeframe of the project, I have learnt many things about the way I operate in a team, and it has boosted my confidence working in a group in the future. </p>
<p>Our team was particularly efficient in regard to our communication methods. All messages and team meetings were conducted exclusively through MS Teams and channels were made to manage different aspects of the project. Another thing our group did really well in was managing deadlines. All of our tasks were completed in a timely manner and if a team member had any issues there was always someone in the team able to help to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>One thing we couldâ€™ve improved on is our consistency of work. While all work produced by the team was of excellent quality, we could have benefitted from having a more planned structure to work with.</p>
<p>I was most surprised with my ability to work in a team. I had expected team work to be more difficult than it was, and I was overthinking how things would go. When initially forming the team, I realized that our team was able to communicate very well, and these worries were gone. I have learnt that when working in a team, you can produce work very quickly and efficiently if organised correctly. </p>

<p>Our group performed even better during Assignment 3 than Assignment 2. We implemented positive change to our processes at the beginning of this assignment and this had major benefits to our workflow and communication. Our use of ToDo as a task planner was a highlight, providing many tangible advantages to our previous haphazard task management that mostly relied on verbal agreements and memory. I noticed that under ToDo tasks seemed to be completed faster, with the transparency of the platform providing motivation to group members to keep on top of their tasks. </p>
<p>Communication was another highlight. We refined our meeting processes and this made them more productive and efficient. Splitting into sub-groups allowed for hyperfocus on sections of the assignment, and this resulted in some very high quality work being produced. </p>
<p>I was surprised at the teamwork displayed when members were struggling with workload. There were at least four instances where members assisted or undertook work on behalf of another, and this work was completed quickly, to an excellent standard, and without complaint or resentment.</p>
<p>I have learned that one of the most fulfilling aspects of group work is when you are able to assist a team member. This may be through sharing knowledge, giving time to explain or demonstrate a process or concept, or it may be by taking on some of their workload when they are overloaded due to time constraints or the difficulty of the task. This is far more rewarding than completing your work alone.</p>
<p>In our meetings we were very good at sharing progress between members so that we all understood the whole project. The only area for improvement in our processes would be to implement some way to integrate every member across the written component of the whole project. This would be a time-consuming process and explains why it was not implemented.</p>

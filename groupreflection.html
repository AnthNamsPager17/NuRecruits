<h1>Group Reflection</h1>

<h2>Bradley Pavey</h2>
<p>Our group communication was key to a successful assignment 2, with our assignments 3 and 5 we kept the same group and were able to improve more when communicating throughout the week in addition to setting up our completion structure to suit our timeframe.For improvement, most of our team members finished tasks set by our internal deadlines effectively, in the future having all participants stick to the agreed upon deadline would be ideal.
</p>
<p>Moving into another two assignments was both exciting and daunting. Surprising me was the amount of work everyone was willing to put in to ensure our work was completed.
When working within groups at a university level it is important that all team members raise their concerns and queries at the start so they can be answered and responded to in a timely fashion and not have them raised when it is too late in the assignment.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Lachlan Jensen</h2>
<p>My time spent with the nuRecruITs team has been a massive personal learning experience. Before beginning the assessment, I was unsure how I would perform in a group environment as I most commonly work individually. During the timeframe of the project, I have learnt many things about the way I operate in a team, and it has boosted my confidence working in a group in the future. </p>
<p>Our team was particularly efficient in regard to our communication methods. All messages and team meetings were conducted exclusively through MS Teams and channels were made to manage different aspects of the project. Another thing our group did really well in was managing deadlines. All of our tasks were completed in a timely manner and if a team member had any issues there was always someone in the team able to help to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>One thing we could’ve improved on is our consistency of work. While all work produced by the team was of excellent quality, we could have benefitted from having a more planned structure to work with.</p>
<p>I was most surprised with my ability to work in a team. I had expected team work to be more difficult than it was, and I was overthinking how things would go. When initially forming the team, I realized that our team was able to communicate very well, and these worries were gone. I have learnt that when working in a team, you can produce work very quickly and efficiently if organised correctly. </p>

<h2>Nicholas Richards</h2>
<p>Our group performed even better during Assignment 3 than Assignment 2. We implemented positive change to our processes at the beginning of this assignment and this had major benefits to our workflow and communication. Our use of ToDo as a task planner was a highlight, providing many tangible advantages to our previous haphazard task management that mostly relied on verbal agreements and memory. I noticed that under ToDo tasks seemed to be completed faster, with the transparency of the platform providing motivation to group members to keep on top of their tasks. </p>
<p>Communication was another highlight. We refined our meeting processes and this made them more productive and efficient. Splitting into sub-groups allowed for hyperfocus on sections of the assignment, and this resulted in some very high quality work being produced. </p>
<p>I was surprised at the teamwork displayed when members were struggling with workload. There were at least four instances where members assisted or undertook work on behalf of another, and this work was completed quickly, to an excellent standard, and without complaint or resentment.</p>
<p>I have learned that one of the most fulfilling aspects of group work is when you are able to assist a team member. This may be through sharing knowledge, giving time to explain or demonstrate a process or concept, or it may be by taking on some of their workload when they are overloaded due to time constraints or the difficulty of the task. This is far more rewarding than completing your work alone.</p>
<p>In our meetings we were very good at sharing progress between members so that we all understood the whole project. The only area for improvement in our processes would be to implement some way to integrate every member across the written component of the whole project. This would be a time-consuming process and explains why it was not implemented.</p>

<h2>Jeremy Baker</h2>
<p>The experience I have gained through this group project will guide me in my future endeavours. The highlights were the communication and organization that MS teams enabled. The management enabled all members to communicate and see exactly what each member was doing with the opportunity to contribute and comment each other's contributions available. The process was transparent with no members forming secret cliques that could have undermined trust in each other and created divisions in the group.</p>
<p>I have had a difficult semester and have struggles to focus on the courses I am enrolled in. My family is at a crossroads with some of us required to volunteer our time to helping a member transition to a new life. The other team members have helped me considerably and it is this among many other supportive acts that I would consider the defining attributes of mature considerate adults.</p>
<p>I would like to have contributed more, I take a great deal of pride in my work and being a less useful team member doesn’t sit well with me. I am very happy with the work the team produced and have learnt some new approaches to counter my procrastination. I am the sort of person who turns up to work and it all “just happens”, the most important part is turning up. I enjoy the work once I am engaged in it, gaining knowledge in computers will assist me in many of future endeavours and in life generally.</p>

<h2>Anthony Namroud</h2>
<p>Assessment 3 was challenging at the start due to our roles in developing the project was not clearly delegated and a lack of communication mid-way of the first week, after that point we quickly became more organised and confident in our delegated roles and followed through by communicating heavily on the rubric requirements for the assessment.</p>
<p> I learnt that consistency with our weekly meetings has been the focus on accomplishing the specifications needed in this assessment, with everyone attending each week and excellent communication in regard to seeking help when needed and completing our designated tasks Microsoft Teams, GitHub and Proto.io.</p>
<p>I can say with confidence that it was great to know that our team was very supportive in the development of this project. Although in most ways we have done well I feel we can improve on our weekly meetings by reducing the duration of everyone’s part in the meeting and try to keep things simplified, when giving an overview of our deliverables. It was amazing to see our team communicate about certain issues, resolve them, and successfully achieve the results to complete this assessment.

<h2>Jacob Brakespeare</h2>
<p>Assignment 3 was an interesting project. What I think went well was, like with assignment 2, the organizational skill of the group, when it came to planning our project and positions within. Our group has strong leadership as well as team members willing and interested in filling roles.</p>
<p>This assignment proved to be the hardest challenge yet. I believe a fair criticism I would place upon myself was my lack of preparation when entering it, as well as a major lack of communication on my part. I was ill for part of this assignment, though that was out of my control, I feel my decision to not inform the group was detrimental and unhelpful on the whole.</p>
<p>One thing that surprised me was how effective and far we actually treaded in this project, I previously would have thought learning and programming a drone would have been to complex an idea to replicate in this assignment but have happily found myself wrong in this instance.</p>
<p>The major take away from this assignment, the most important thing I learnt was the importance of communication in a group setting. The willingness of team members to help or to communicate important information was invaluable.</p>

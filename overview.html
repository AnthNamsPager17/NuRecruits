      <h2><p> An Emergency drone is on the way.</p><p>Please keep a close eye for any change in symptoms.</p></h2>

<h1>Overview</h1>
  <h2>Topic</h2>
    <p>The main goal for our IT project is to save lives. We believe this should be the first priority when finding new uses for up-and-coming technology. For our team project we plan to take currently existing drone technology and develop new use cases and accompanying technologies which aid in our goal of saving lives. Our Aim is to take our first steps in developing a drone which can be deployed to any location with speed and efficiency, while carrying lifesaving equipment such as, defibrillators, oxygen tanks, epi-pens or first aid kits. These drones will be able to get to the location of any emergency, regardless of terrain and in most situations will be able to do so faster than current first responders. Our proposed drones will provide vital support in situations where speed is critical. If we succeed in our implementation, we will see a significant increase in response times and survival rates across various medical emergencies such as cardiac arrest, allergic reactions, severe bleeding, breathing difficulties, and fits/seizures. Throughout our team, we lack any significant experience with app development, programming, and general drone flight so our first steps will involve forming research teams to investigate and begin development in these areas.</p>
    <p>The research we perform will be the first step for our team to deliver outcomes and tangible developments in our project. Our team plans to begin research and development of an app or software, which enables users who are in distress to use their mobile device or smartwatch to summon a drone to their location. The app will use biometric data to identify patients and then request their location. We also plan to begin development on a program that allows users to set dynamic flight paths based on GPS coordinates and allows for medical flight controllers to monitor the flight and manually take control, if necessary, all operated from a central control station. Various tests will be performed to gain an understanding and determine the requirements for our drones. These tests will include studies such as, determining the weight of required cargo and how it will affect drone performance, assessing required speed and range of our drones to determine hardware requirements, and testing battery life to ensure that our drones will have the required power capacity. The team has plans to develop a marketing campaign aimed towards government bodies that might be interested in implementing and funding our drones so that saving lives can become a reality. As part of our campaign, we will develop an advertisement video and website that will utilize the research we have conducted to present the information that will best support our cause. The team is aiming to get as far as possible in the development of our product within the limited allocated timeframe. Because of this projects time constraint, detailed and efficient research into these areas will be vital in our teams’ success.</p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>We are passionate about reducing human reliance on road travel and transport. Humans are poorly equipped to operate motor vehicles (Webber 2019), driving is an inefficient use of our time (Vella 2016), road networks suffocate large portions of the surface of the earth (Watts 2019), and the greenhouse gases of fossil-fuelled vehicles are poisoning our planet (Henriques-Gomez, 2018).</p>
    <p>Australia, in particular, has a dependence on oil-powered vehicles due to the great size of its land and separation between population hubs (Martin, 2019). This impacts national security as our oil stockpiles hover at precipitous levels.</p>
    <p>There is a global trend in IT towards the uptake of autonomous vehicles across all sectors, industries and scenarios (Kulkarni, 2020). While inter-city connectedness in Australia may be the last pillar to fall for oil-powered vehicles, it is not unimaginable that cities will be linked by autonomous, electric trains and/or road trains. While this does not solve all the nationwide distribution issues, it does simplify and separate them between the distinct need of intra-city distribution and travel and intercity distribution and travel.</p>
    <p>We envisage transport and logistics hubs on the outskirts of each major population centre as the crossover platform between these two thresholds. Bulk goods are transported long distances between cities, and then offloaded to smaller scale aerial distribution networks for arrival at human residences. Similarly, fast, large-capacity transport modes terminate at these hubs, whereby individuals are transported by autonomous and network-linked vehicles to their home, most likely by aerial route.</p>
    <p>In denser regions of the world the overlap between these paradigms would coalesce into one vast network of autonomous distribution and travel.</p>
    <p>The advantages of this are tangible and important, for human ease, environmental impact, efficiency and speed, and allocation of precious space resources in urban environments.</p>
    <p>To break our reliance on the legacy system of individual, oil-powered, human-driven road transport, a powerful and reliable case study of an alternative needs to be built, with a strong business case for cost versus benefit. The <nu>recruITs plan for medical response drones is the perfect gateway to the modernisation of Australian, and global, transport and distribution.</p>
    <p>The cost and impact on society is negligible, but the benefit to human lives is concrete and measurable. Within years of inception we predict data will confirm the efficacy of medical response drones. Many lives will have been saved, and in the course of those years, public trust in automated drone technology will rise, making way for the technology to expand into further fields, including delivery of household and consumer goods. We predict this will combine with autonomous vehicle technology, in addition to solar and battery technology, to quickly cascade into full automation of human movement and human needs distribution.</p>
    <p>This project would demonstrate to a future employer our ability as a team to draw together various strands of current technology into a project that positively benefits society and models a successful transition into the future of logistics. It can show that we are across the latest advancements in automation, robotics, cyber security, wearable technology, programming and application development.</p>

  <h2>Landscape</h2>
  <p>Systems that use drones and closely relate to our project include ideas based on some emergency situations such as, rapid search and rescue programs, crime prevention and simulation, and disaster readiness and response systems (Karsten, et al., 2018). Another system formed for drone use is to eliminate long distance travel from remote areas, for medical supplies to reach patients who require them (Waters, 2021).</p>
  <p>“Medical deliveries by drone are ready for take-off in Australia, with start-up Swoop Aero expecting to start bringing medicines to regional patients in May (Waters, 2021).”</p>
  <p>There are many competitors basing their drone designs around emergency and medical needs, though only one competitor stands out towards a similarity to what we want to achieve, and that organisation is Swoop Aero who has a focus in the medical department use of drones.</p>
  <p>The project we focus on is more in relation of emergency requirements rather than medicinal requirements, which means instead of providing prescribed medication for a cold, or high blood pressure, our project aims to provide equipment such as a defibrillator, epi-pen, Gauze pads, insulin, anti-venom for poisonous insects and reptiles, and bandages, etc, that may be required in a life-threatening situation. Our drone will also have a user friendly app that will help guide patients or witnesses at the time of the emergency, by providing medical procedures on how to use the equipment supplied by the drone, through the health department forums, and with a strong focus on biometric data that help to identify the status of the patient’s condition, and their medical needs in an emergency within a short period of time, while ambulance health officials make their way to the scene and take over control of patient needs. Swoop Aero only provides prescribed medication for people who must travel long distance to acquire it. We aim to try and implement our drones at every emergency department and government building in a suburb, such as police stations, fire stations, hospitals, local community halls, schools, etc, with every suburb geographical plan being programmed into it, to help abide with drone laws and legislations, and to help cope with rapid demands for emergency equipment and supplies when needed.</p>

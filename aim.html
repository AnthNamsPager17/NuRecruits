<h1>Our Aim</h1>
<p>The aim of our project is to develop cutting edge technology with the aim of saving lives. We believe that saving lives should be the first thing that should be considered when finding uses for new technologies. When discussing ideas amongst group we decided on the idea of developing a medical drone that utilizes the power of GPS and AI to save lives. The medical drones we plan to make are drones that can carry lifesaving equipment to your location faster than an ambulance can get to you.</p>
<p>In order to achieve our aim of saving lives there are many goals that we need to succeed in. These goals have been separated into three main categories or “pillars”. We have assigned members of the team to focus their efforts on these areas to ensure that we have demonstrated progress to all required goals. The three main goals are to develop a drone control centre program, develop a marketing campaign to gain funding, and develop an application/web app that allows users to summon drones to their location.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<h3>Develop a Drone Control Centre Program</h3>
<p>One of our teams’ main goals is to write a program that will act as a control centre for our drones, allowing drone pilots to monitor and navigate our drones as they fly to patients. This control centre should allow the user to set static flight paths for a drone to fly and should also allow for manual flight control via user input. Whenever the drone pilot at the control centre takes manual control of the drone, they will need to be able to see a video feed from the drone to ensure a correct flight path. The program will be able to receive GPS coordinates from an app or web app that will the instruct the drone where to fly during an emergency. The program will be written in the Python programming language and adapted to any other suitable languages in the future. The process of software development is ongoing, and we don’t foresee a time when we can say this goal is “complete”, however within the scope of this project, if we create some working code that demonstrates our ideas, we will consider this a success towards our aim of developing a lifesaving drone.
</p>

<h3>Develop an Application/Web App</h3>
<p>Creating and designing an app and website, that is user friendly with an enhanced user experience, has a button feature integrated to activate and send coordinates to our emergency drones, and implementing a flow chart to visually explain our goals and progress. As we only have 15 weeks to complete our project, if we should have limited time and resources to complete our goals, we would choose to prioritize our enhanced graphical user interface and user-friendly app and website designs. Our aim is to make a website and app, that will assist our teams project idea reach people over the cyber-verse, with as much detail, eye catching graphics, and user-friendly feature to assist all ages in understanding our product.</p>

<h3>Develop a Marketing Campaign</h3>
<p>We will develop a video and website that can market our product towards its intended buyers, which will be government agencies, we envision that these agencies will allow us to continue to develop our technology through their funding. We are going to research different case studies into how our drone will benefit the public. These case studies will be our examples on why the government would benefit from our drone technology and then why they should invest into our idea.  These case studies will form part of our presentation on why it is important our drones do what they do.</p>

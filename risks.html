<h1>Risks</h1>

<p>There are many risks associated with developing a medical drone that need to be considered. These risks are present during both the development phase and the implementation phase. Careful consideration to these risks will allow our project to be as successful as possible. Due to our limited experience in developing drones, there were many risks that our team was not aware of when beginning our project. We were able to identify these risks throughout the development process and adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>One risk associated with our project was not knowing which programming language to base our project on. This decision is a vital step when beginning development and choosing an unsuitable language can lead to dead ends further down the line in development. While some team members had limited experience with the python language, we were unsure if it would have limitations in regard to programming drones. There is always a potential risk of running into a dead end and having to start with new ideas from scratch, so itâ€™s important to identify these issues early on. Another risk that was identified by our team was the potential for damaging drone hardware during the testing process. Tests had to be conducted with caution and an emergency landing function was written into every program before testing to minimize the risk of damage or loss of hardware.</p>
<p>In the future when our drones start to become implemented in populated areas there are many risks that we will need to consider. One risk is the potential for injury to pedestrians if our drones were to fail mid-flight. In order to prevent this, we must thoroughly test our drones and implement safety measures to ensure that our drones are as safe as possible. Our team goal is to save lives and if our drones are a risk to civilians, it will never align with our goals. Another risk identified by our team that needs to be considered is that there may be laws that will prevent our drones from being implemented in some areas. Extensive research needs to be conducted on each individual location we plan on implementing our drones, ensuring that we abide by all laws and regulations.</p>
<p>One risk that must be considered is the risk of the public having privacy concerns regarding our drones. It is likely that some civilians will not like the idea of having drones with cameras flying above their homes. The public opinion is very important when implementing our drones and it could be a make-or-break factor in our development.</p>
<p>Arguably the most important risk to consider is the risk of not receiving government support to implement our drones. Currently a vast majority of our plans rely on this component being a success and some serious considerations must be made about what alternative paths we can take to implement our project if our main idea fails.</p>

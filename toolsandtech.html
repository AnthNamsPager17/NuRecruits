<h2>Introduction<h2>



<h3>GitHub</h3>

<p>GitHub is an online repository for constructing computer software, it allows multiple programmers to work, collaborate and access work on their own computer in real time. Changes to code are highlighted and tracked so other users can comment on changes to code. GitHub supports a wide variety of formats and features including Email notifications, nested task lists within files, bug tracking and can also track individuals' contributions, commits, code frequency, with all members activity recorded projects can be easily managed. Git Hub is also open sourced; sharing, and teaching is encouraged. Private repositories are also available and its use for all services is free, including training programs.

<h3>PyCharm Community Edition 2021.2.3</h3>

<p>PyCharm is an IDE (integrated Development Environment), that provides many tools that increase the code quality, speed, and ease.

<h3>Python 3.7.6</h3>

<p>Programming languages use strings to enable machine code output, programmers use the languages to create algorithms. Python is a simple easy to learn and use programming language that has 28 thousand developers from over 150 countries. The simplicity of Pythons scripting emphasizes readability which translates to enabling many programmers being able to tackle a project together. A large knowledge base and library supports Python with many freely distributed.

<h3>Scratch</h3>

Scratch is a free programming language provided by MIT that allows users to create interactive stories, animations, and games. The block-style language is a transitional form from pseudo-code to a programming language such as Python. It is a useful teaching aid for beginning programmers to think creatively and develop the systematic reasoning and logic required to become proficient in all computer programming languages

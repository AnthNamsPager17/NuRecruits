<h1>Tools & Technologies</h1>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The tools and technologies we used were based on their learning curve, relevance, price (free) and contemporary use. A useful analogy can be made between cooking and our project. If our overall project was a three-course meal the planning, preparation, and execution/presentation all require knowledge, experience, and tools to produce a quality product. Some tools specialize in one aspect and do it very well, (blender/ Krita). Others have many applications and uses but may only be used in a limited fashion to produce our product. Cooks require many different tools to make their work faster, easier, and most importantly, consistent high-quality products. The same applies to producing computer-based projects with hardware, software and programming all combining for an integrated smooth end user experience. </p>
<p>There are many tools and technologies that our team will utilize to be successful in our project. In order to communicate and collaborate the team will be using Microsoft Teams and GitHub. We will need physical drone hardware in order to begin development. The team will need text editing software to write and test our website and programs as well as a Python interpreter to run our Drone Control Centre program, PyCharm Community edition 2021.2.3 and Python 3.7.6 have been chosen for this purpose. Software will be required to develop a prototype of our app. Research was conducted and after some dead ends the team decided on proto.io for app development. Cameras and video editing software will be required to produce the marketing advertisement and to record the testing of our drone. DaVinci Resolve was chosen as our video editing software due to it easy to use interface.</p>
<p>When selecting software and hardware for our team to use we have to be mindful of costs and licencing as the team currently has limited resources available. Due to this we have to be mindful of any Licenses that may be required and opt for free versions of any software if available. </p>
<h3>GitHub</h3>

<p>GitHub is an online repository for constructing computer software, it allows multiple programmers to work, collaborate and access work on their own computer in real time. Changes to code are highlighted and tracked so other users can comment on changes to code. GitHub supports a wide variety of formats and features including Email notifications, nested task lists within files, bug tracking and can also track individuals' contributions, commits, code frequency, with all members activity recorded projects can be easily managed. Git Hub is also open sourced; sharing, and teaching is encouraged. Private repositories are also available and its use for all services is free, including training programs.

<h3>PyCharm Community Edition 2021.2.3</h3>
<p>We used PyCharm to write all of our code during this assignment. While there were many options for which IDE to use, we decided on this one as it was quite easy to use and allowed for collaboration.</p>
<p>PyCharm is an IDE (integrated Development Environment), that provides many tools that increase the code quality, speed, and ease.
  <ul>
      <li>Keyboard-centric shortcuts, provide shortcuts</li>

      <li>Error checking, editing, and debugging with quick fixes</li>

      <li>Project navigation is simplified</li>

      <li>Vast library and community support</li>

      <li>PEP8 checks improve coding quality</li>
  </ul>


<h3>Python 3.7.6</h3>
<p>We used Python 3.7.6, rather than the latest version due to Open CV instability on the most recent versions. Python was chosen as our programming language as it is the language that we had the most experience in throughout out group.</p>

<p>Programming languages use strings to enable machine code output, programmers use the languages to create algorithms. Python is a simple easy to learn and use programming language that has 28 thousand developers from over 150 countries. The simplicity of Pythons scripting emphasizes readability which translates to enabling many programmers being able to tackle a project together. A large knowledge base and library supports Python with many freely distributed.
<br></br>

<h3>Scratch</h3>

<p>Scratch is a free programming language provided by MIT that allows users to create interactive stories, animations, and games. The block-style language is a transitional form from pseudo-code to a programming language such as Python. It is a useful teaching aid for beginning programmers to think creatively and develop the systematic reasoning and logic required to become proficient in all computer programming languages</p>



<h3>DJI Tello Drone</h3>
<p>This drone was chosen due to its cheap price and compatibility with the python programming language. There are many other more suitable drones for future development, however for this project, this drone will suffice.</p>

<p>He DJI Tello drone is a small quadcopter suitable for flying indoors. It features a camera which enables a vision positioning system, up to 5-megapixel photos and streaming 720p video to an app on a mobile phone. Range is around 100m and flying time is roughly 13 minutes.</p>



<h3>Tello SDK 1.3.0.0</h3>â€¯

<p>The team utilised the Tello SDK to develop their initial prototype program. Tello SDK allows for development of a Tello drone. It allows users to establish a connection through a Wi-Fi UPD port that can send information to and from the drone. It enables scripts to be transmitted to the aircraft that control its movement.</p>


<h3>MS Teams</h3>

<p>MS teams bring together a range of tools in one handy package, the software is based on improving communication between members of a team. It features a messaging app and a workspace for collaboration that enables video conferencing, file and app sharing.</p>


<h3>Krita</h3>

<p>Krita is an open-sourced painting program that provides a high-quality interface, created by artists for artists. Customization and providing many options are a feature of Krita, photo editing is one of these features utilised in our assignment.</p>


<h3>DaVinci resolve</h3>

<p>DaVinci resolve is a post-production editing suite that enables colour correction, visual effects, motion graphics, and audio.</p>


<h3>Proto.io</h3>
<p>Proto.io is an easy-to-use app make with drag and drop features with no coding element. The use of proto.io to develop and make our app was very simple, fun to learn and exciting to see your design come to life in real time with their preview functionality integral in view what out app would look like. Using proto.io took a lot of hassle out of developing an app for our project. This was the main reason we opted for proto.io, so we could focus more on the main project idea and produce an easy-to-use interface for our app. </p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>A wide variety of tutorials from all sorts of sources enabled us to come to terms with using our tools. Most provide simple training and tutorials however tutorials are available all over the WWW with you tube being a good starting point.</p>

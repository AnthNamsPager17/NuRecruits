Changes to code are highlighted and tracked so other users can comment on changes to code. GitHub supports a wide variety of formats and features including Email notifications, nested task lists within files, bug tracking and can also track individuals' contributions, commits, code frequency, with all members activity recorded projects can be easily managed. Git Hub is also open sourced; sharing, and teaching is encouraged. Private repositories are also available and its use for all services is free, including training programs.

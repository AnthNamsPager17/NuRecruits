<h1>Testing</h1>

<p>Testing will be a vital part of the development of all three of our main goals. The testing process will begin at the same time as development commences and will continue throughout the development process. The testing will become more rigorous towards the end of the project timeframe to ensure that the team is successfully meeting their project goals.</p>

<p>While writing the code for the ‘drone control center’ program the testing process will be constant throughout. Minor testing will be conducted as any changes are made to the code to ensure there are no bugs that slip into the code. At the end of each development session, we will test the programs we have developed thoroughly to identify what needs to be worked on in the following development sessions. When the initial prototype of the program is completed, we will conduct various tests on the program to ensure that it meets our requirements. These tests will include, planning a flight for the drone and executing it without the need for human input, testing the manual control functionality by ensuring it correctly controls the drone, and testing various speeds and altitude limitations to ensure the program will be suitable for implementation in areas with increased population and specific safety regulations. We will know our testing is successfully completed when we can confidently say that all of our test results meet our teams’ goals.</p>

<p>The development of the marketing campaign will be harder to properly test as it is designed to be presented to government bodies who are interested in our drones. There are many steps that we need to take before we are at this stage so in the meantime testing will be conducted by comparing research data with the contents of our marketing video. This will ensure that our marketing advertisement contains all of the required elements to interest the target audience.</p>

<p>The testing required for our application and website department will be around the development of the Emergency Button (EB) and creating a one-time user account, then applying four main functions such as,</p>
<div id="lachlist">
    <ol>
      <li>Implementing a one-time form for users to fill out and create an account to store their personal information for emergency use only. User information will NOT be sold to third parties and will remain confidential and protected under privacy laws and legislation requirements.</li>

      <li>Connecting a form to the EB to store emergency information given by the user to notify the emergency department upon pressing it. Emergency Information will consist of patient symptoms, Global Positioning Service (GPS) coordinates or account residential addresses, if the user is the patient or the by-stander assisting in the emergency and alerting the drone command centre for monitoring of drone status.</li>

      <li>Sending GPS coordinates and activation code to the drone for instantaneous delivery of emergency equipment and medical supplies.</li>

      <li>Linking videos after alerting the emergency department and drone control centre of the underlying emergency, giving detailed information in relation to the correct use of the medical equipment and supplies provided by our drone.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
<p>Implementing these features to our button will be crucial in our products functionality and reliability to provide the emergency requirements. This will need frequent testing and may exceed the 15-week timeframe given to assure the success of our drones intended and primary use.</p>

<h1>Our Job Roles</h1>
<h2>Nicholas Richards’ Role – Data Analyst and Marketing Assistant</h2>
<p>I have been assigned the job title Data Analyst and Marketing Assistant. This role entails the creation of 6-8 detailed and compelling case studies that will support the business objectives of our IT Project. The case studies will demonstrate the overwhelming benefits of drone delivery of life saving equipment using real world or realistic hypothetical scenarios. They will need to include comparative mapping, analysis with calculated current response times, and an in-depth analysis of this raw data to provide insights to inform decision making regarding the viability of the project.</p>
<p>This data will be fed into our marketing plan to present to government and/or industry in order to secure funding for infrastructure as well as policy and licensing approval. I will be responsible for collecting the data, instigating the case studies, undertaking analysis, and presentation of useful insights utilising visual and auditory presentation aids and communication skills.</p>

<h2>Bradley Pavey’s Role – Project Manager</h2>

I will be organising the timeframe section of this project, this will include the 6 weeks that we have for it and what we could accomplish if we did an extra 10 weeks as well.  I will also help in marketing by creating an ad that is tailored to government agencies, in addition to working on our presentation for our assignment.</p>

<h2>Anthony Namroud’s Role – Application/Website Development</h2>
<p>The role delegated to me was leading the Website Development. My role was mainly aimed at developing the website and fixing code issues in the HyperText Markup Language (html) files, and the implementation of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and consisted of using tools such as GitHub Desktop, GitHub Repositories, use of different browsers and Atom to help with the progress of the development. This role helps to promote our product through web site design, information, and user interface, by providing specifics to our end goals as a group. My role could require me to look further into other primary sources of information to connect to our app, and apply extra features like access through a website, and the use of fingerprint scanners or facial recognition to make it more user friendly, and secure across all devices. Changes to my role will also consist of testing our product to provide a status of development into its success, using video footage of a drone programmed to do as it needs to, and proof of its maximum carrying capacity to fulfill emergency requirements upon its delivery to the scene. My role will change between App Development, Web Site Development and Product Testing on a weekly basis.</p>

  <h1>Scopes and Limits</h1>

  <p>When developing the idea for our project, our team had many great ideas and initially we had planned to incorporate as many different aspects as possible in order to appeal to the interests of all members of the group. However, there are limitations to what our team will be able to achieve by the end of this assessment, this meant we had to adjust our plans to not take on more than we could handle. Limiting the scope of what we aim to achieve will hopefully allow us to produce higher quality results in the components we focus on. All members within our team possess very limited knowledge when it comes to application development, programming drones and marketing. This lack of knowledge means that significant portions of our time will be dedicated to research, reducing our available time to spend on actual application development, writing of code and development of a marketing strategy. Due to the limited timeframe allocated to complete our project, we will not be able to achieve all of our team’s goals before the conclusion of this assessment. The fact that we will not be able to complete all of our goals means that our team will have to work efficiently and give priority to the most important components of our project.</p>

  <p>Within the scope of the project our efforts will be focused on three main components, designing a mobile application to summon our drone, writing a ‘Control Centre’ program to remotely control the drone both manually and automatically, based on GPS coordinates, and seeking approval for our drones from any government body that wish to implement our drones. While we are setting out with the hope of completing these components, we do not expect this to be the case, due to our limited experience. Our team has set minimum requirements for what we aim to achieve, in regard to code writing, app development and marketing. In regard to the application, at the very least we plan to produce a prototype design for our application, focusing on the frontend and UI. In regard to the ‘Control Centre’ program, we aim to write at least some working code that will demonstrate our concept, regardless of how basic the code may be. This code must at a minimum, control the drones flight and allow for custom flight paths. In regard to gaining support from government bodies, we are going to conduct research to determine exactly what we will need to be successful in legally deploying our drones. Using the knowledge, we gain from our research we will develop an advertisement directed to any government bodies interested in implementing our lifesaving drones.</p>

  <p>Beyond the scope of our project, we aim to fully develop and complete our drone summoning application that allows users to summon drones based on their GPS coordinates, this app will be user friendly and easily integrated into the OS of their device. As well as developing a working application, in the future we also aim to develop code that can act as an all-in-one flight controller for our drones, the aim of the program is to allow for the automatic control of drones utilizing machine learning in a similar fashion to driverless cars, while also allowing a medical flight controller to take manual control of the drones at any point if necessary. In order for these drones to become commonplace in the future, they will need to be approved by all government bodies or areas we wish to implement our product. The plan to actually seek government approval comes much later into the development of our project and will be well outside the limits of our current timeframe. Currently we are reliant on drone hardware developed by 3rd party manufacturers, in the future we aim to change this and develop our own drone hardware in-house to allow for our own security measures to be put in place. While most of these goals are out of reach, any developments that work towards producing these outcomes will be considered a success by our team.</p>

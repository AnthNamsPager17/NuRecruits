<div id="test">
      <br><li><strong>Name:</strong> Bradley Pavey</li><li><strong>Student Number:</strong> s3548357</li><li><strong>Representing Group:</strong> &ltnu&gtrecruITs</li></br>
</div>
      <p><strong>About Bradley:</strong></p>
    <p>I played sport from the age of seven years old. Until I was seventeen years old. I played basketball as a point guard and I played almost everyday of the week, most weekends I would play between three to four games all at separate stadiums as well as train and play more games during the week. I would be a leader on the court, running team plays, giving other players confidence to take an opportunity when they are open for it. I was known for my defensive skills, ball control, ability to read and run a play. I would call out our defense strategy on the court in real time, back myself and the team in. I learned to be a referee of the sport as well. I would always play right on the edge sometimes being fouled out many times. I would play aggressive but fair, with mind games involved as a separate aspect of game to get in my opponents heads. I Became interested in I.T through my Father and Brothers. My brothers always played games when I was younger, they have all played World of Warcraft since it was first released. I use to play on my brother's computer when I was eight years old. I would play his World of Warcraft account while he would teach me how to play the game. This is what peaked my interest in I.T. I was amazed at the fact I could play games with people who were not in the same house. Moving on from games my father is really into programming through linux, especially with everything you can do with a raspberry pi and this is where I get my love for programming from. I am someone who is Australian through and through, I have a sense to protect my country and it is a dream of mine to be able to do so. I choose cyber analyst because I believe that the next global conflict will be based around computers and countries sensitive data before any physical conflict.
      </P>


    <h4>My Career Plan:</h4>
    <p>Brad’s ideal job is a cyber security analyst. Brad plans to study online at a university level with cyber security and networking be an integral part in the elective subjects. He wishes to gain experience from the Australian Signals Decorate (or ASD - https://www.asd.gov.au/ ) by completing a cadet or internship while studying at university. It is his intention that by completing this internship/cadet program that he will learn firsthand about cyber security analysts by physically learning on the job through this program.</p>

    <p>Brad currently only has a certificate III in Media which was completed in 2014 during schooling. The certificate III is more tailored to gaming and making character designs which will not help in achieving the goals of a cyber security analyst. Brad has extensive knowledge in how to learn by self-troubleshoot throughout his years as a retail manager and by building several computers for himself and people within his inner circle.</p>

    <img src="images/lachlansphotos/lachlan.png" alt="a picture of Lachlan Jenson" class="centerimg">
    <br><li><strong>Name:</strong> Lachlan Jensen</li><li><strong>Student Number:</strong> s3922643</li><li><strong>Representing Group:</strong> &ltnu&gtrecruITs</li><br>
    <h4>About Lachlan:</h4>
      <p>My name is Lachlan Jensen, and I am part of the nuRecruITs team. I was born in Melbourne, Victoria. Throughout my childhood, my family travelled a lot due to my father’s occupation. This led to me completing the majority of my schooling outside of Australia, in countries such as Switzerland, Malaysia and the United States. During this time abroad it allowed me to experience many different cultures and meet some extremely interesting people. I think that this experience helps me relate to a wide range of people and has helped me get the most out of life. My favourite hobbies are Music, PC gaming and Anime/Manga. I learnt the Guitar and Piano from an early age from my grandmother and I have been playing since then. Music is a huge part of my life, and I couldn’t imagine spending a whole day away from my guitar. I first became interested in IT from playing computer games at an early age and have recently begun to formalise my knowledge by completing my Diploma in Information Technology Networking, I am now studying at RMIT to get a degree and to continue to build my skills.
      </p>

<h4>My Career Plan:</h4>

<p>Lachlan’s ideal job is to become a Network Engineer. His ideal profession has remained the same throughout the duration of this course and his drive to achieve his goals is only increasing. The career plan that will enable Lachlan to become a network engineer involves goals such as completing a degree in Information Technology, completing CCNA R&S certification, gaining experience working at a Managed Service Provider (MSP) and overall building a vast set of skills across all fields of information technology. Lachlan’s career plan shares many similarities to other career plans within his group, such as Jeremy Baker’s plan to become a cloud engineer and Anthony Namroud’s plan to become a cybersecurity engineer. Network engineer, Cloud engineer, and Cybersecurity engineer are all positions that require an extensive level of networking knowledge and experience. The paths to achieve each of these career goals share many similarities, such as all career plans beginning with earning a degree in IT and all of them requiring many years of experience working in the field of networking or at an MSP. Since the journey to achieve these goals share so many similarities it shows that the skills, we develop for our ideal job can be useful across many different professions, not just the one we plan for now, allowing our ideal jobs to evolve over time and adapt to the everchanging IT landscape.

<div class="bradleymain">
<img src="images/nicholas'sphotos/nicholas_richards.jpg" alt="A picture of Nicholas Richards." height="170px">
    <p><li><strong>Name:</strong> Nicholas Richards</li><li><strong>Student Number:</strong> S3923381</li><li><strong>Representing Group:</strong> &ltnu&gtrecruITs</li></p><p><li><strong>About Nicholas:</strong></li>
    I work as a professional firefighter and live in the NSW Southern Highlands. I am a nerd in a jock's body: I love to lift weights and carve up a touch footy field, but prefer to play a board game or talk philosophy and history than watch cricket or have a beer at the pub. I dabbled in coding as my first 'lockdown hobby' of 2020 and was instantly hooked on the dopamine dump I received when the machine did what I instructed it to. I love the logic, precision and predictability of programming, and the tricks you can learn to make your code more attractive, efficient and powerful.</p>
    <p>I am a turbulent architect personality type, so I am insightful and analytical, but shy and doubtful. I make an excellent contributor in a small group, producing high calibre work and able to see perspectives others may miss. I struggle in larger groups or leadership roles, and work best under an engaging and encouraging leader who draws me out of my introversion to share my thoughts. I have some affinity for all three learning styles, so it is important that I try to incorporate auditory, visual and kinesthetic components. This may be beneficial in the group as I am able to translate an idea from one learning style to another and boost the understanding of the whole team. The Big 5 personality test revealed that I am high in openness and agreeableness, so I will be a supportive team member, receptive to the ideas of others, and work hard to see those ideas realised.</p>



<h4>My Career Plan:</h4>
    <p>Nicholas' ideal job remains a data and evaluation lead at a non-profit organisation. I am even more passionate about using data and machine learning to build convincing presentations and business cases.</p>
    <p>I am confident in the career plan I have developed, featuring gradual exposure to more senior leadership positions within the project management team of data analysis. The Bachelor of IT will be the perfect starting platform, with some supplementary study in statistics to ensure I have the required comprehensive understanding of data.</p>
    <p>This course has provided a good groundwork for presentation skills. I am looking forward to making an impact in the presentation of our Group IT Project. Marketing, persuasion, and manufacturing compelling arguments are skills I have and desire to implement.</p>
    <p>This career is a standout in our group, as it stands in the convergence of information technology with stakeholders, both technical and non-technical, decision makers and users. This highlights the diverse range of careers available in the IT industry, and the importance of soft skills to secure many of these roles.</p>
    <p>As such it has a lower technical knowledge requirement than many other careers chosen by the group, but a greater demand for presentation and project management skills.</p>

    <strong><h2>About Jeremy:</h2></strong>
</div>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my profile, hopefully I can provide some information about my past present and future. I could be considered as being middle aged; however, I still feel I’m pretty much the same as when I was younger. I feel a lot less worry getting older, and I try to keep a positive perspective on things. My hobbies are reading, gardening, cooking and generally finding interesting things on the www. Previously I had studied laboratory technology Information, a fascinating broad field and now information technology has become my choice of study. Before beginning this, I had very little experience in IT, other than being an end user. It is a bit frustrating sometimes but there is almost always a solution somewhere. It is a genuine challenge, and I am enjoying learning and applying new skills.
    </p>
    <p>My personaility tests found I am mediator/ investigative type Personality with realistic and artistic traits. I enjoy being on the innovative edge, pushing leadership and  organization forward with a strong imagination and a willingness to take calculated risks. I think leadership is best provided by empowering others. Empowering others to share the role of leadership helps create a better world. I feel I am now at a crossroad in life and I am searching for something that will best suit my abilities as well as share and enjoy.</p>



<h4>My Career Plan:</h4>
<p>My ideal job is still very much undecided, there are quite a lot of different career paths, and the industry is evolving with the technology. At this early stage if I could tentatively commit to an area, it would be to get in on the ground floor with a large, profitable, established enterprise with a well-known brand. One Seek job advertisement that piqued my interest was the reserve bank of Australia’s graduate development program in information technology.  I would think this would require very high grades and endorsements to obtain a position like this, however. I think that many other companies would be offering similar roles and I believe that in the months before graduation their existence is made aware to graduating classes.</p>

<p>I am an older student, and this may lead me to become a more attractive proposition for a less cutting-edge position where my duties may not require reinventing the wheel as much as aiding in keeping it turning. This could involve transitioning a business to implement a cloud computing via virtual machines, which I am quite interested in and believe can provide small businesses with many options and solutions to their computing needs. To summarize my ideal job will be something I enjoy, gives me purpose and satisfaction while hurting none.</p>

    <p><li><strong>Name:</strong> Anthony Namroud</li><li><strong>Student Number:</strong> S3925380</li><li><strong>Background:</strong> Australian / Lebanese</li><li><strong>Representing Group:</strong> &ltnu&gtrecruITs</li></p>
</div


    <strong><h2>About Anthony:</h2></strong>

      <p>Hi, I’m Anthony, at a young age my passion for information technology (IT) which started in gaming, HTML programming, CSS formatting and the use of Microsoft (MS) Excel (including macros). My favourite hobbies include, spending time with family, camping, fishing, designing my own MS Excel budgeting platform and watching YouTube. I have no current experience in IT, though my interest in IT grew out of self-learning and to seek a change in my career from working in a warehouse, then to achieve my goal of getting my job of interest in Cyber Security.</p>
    <p>Even though I am happy being seen as an assertive protagonist, these results show some areas that I could work on with some development gained through experience, such as my nature, energy, and tactics. I could show more of a focus on the thinking side and less on the feeling side when it comes to my nature, my energy needs to have more of a spontaneous approach and my tactics should be less judging and promote a more of an inviting approach. Given my current results I feel this could impact my team’s behaviour in a negative way and I will work towards developing these skills and experiences, to help with my efforts in team cooperation and progression, not only showing benefits as an individual, but also advancing my team’s morals in achieving main goals.These tests have boosted my confidence to a certain degree, although there is no evidence to suggest that they are scientifically proven to work, I will still use these results in a way to improve the areas of concern in a positive manner.
    </p>

    <strong><h2> My Career Plan:</h2></strong>
    <p>Common elements found in six of the ideal jobs listed in our group’s skillsets, show a networking nature for maintenance, protection, quality control, programming trends and cost effectiveness for all business networks. Although I wish to become a Cyber Security Engineer, these elements show there is a definite need to expand my skillsets towards Network Engineering and Cloud Engineering.</p>
    <p>The differences between Cyber Security Engineers, Networking Engineers and Cloud Engineers shows that there is a requirement for more data analysis, technical skills, and a display of level of demand is higher than cyber security engineering regarding career opportunities.</p>
    <p>Cyber Security Engineers have a broader spectrum towards network, data protection, and a “high level of computer forensic competence (Degree, 2021)” for businesses, public users, and government departments to help against the fight of cybercrime. Some careers range from a more competitive nature, such as Video Game Developers and Cloud Engineers, while other careers require a more complex understanding of their job requirements, such as Network Engineers, and Software Engineers. My career plans have shown me that I need to expand my knowledge base into other skillsets to better combine the need for protection and development in software and technological design. To better progress in my career I have decided to further my studies in Network Engineering in Computer and Technology, and Cloud Engineering.</p>

    <p><li><strong>Name:</strong> Jacob Brakespeare</li><li><strong>Student Number:</strong> S3921370</li><li><strong>Representing Group:</strong> &ltnu&gtrecruITs</li><li></p><p><li><strong>About Jacob:</strong></li>I live on a farm in the beautiful south-west of West Australia, where I spend most of my day working and raising livestock. I love history, the good, the bad, the Crazy and everything in-between.
       I also have a love for Movies, Books, Video games & Music, all of which at some point in my life shaped me into who I am. I have always considered myself as someone with a very logical Straightforward mind, which I think has lead me towards IT. The ability to construct formulas and rules all with set paths and outcomes is a very positive aspect I would love to work with in my work-life. </p>
    <p>I am a Turbulent Mediator personality architype, so I am diplomatic and intuitive in my interactions, though I am also quite introverted and reserved when I interact with unknown people and situations. I find I usually perform best in larger groups and when I can have specific tasks to repeat. After I gain confidence in my duties for work I can enter leadership positions quite confidently. My test results suggested I had a near balance for the three learning styles, Visual, Audio and Kinaesthetic, but I will state I Believe I excel in Kinaesthetic learning above all else. This should also reflect in my ability to correct mistakes quickly after early attempts. This would hopefully make a great anchor point in a team when it comes to consistency. My IQ test revealed a high IQ, which is a great display of my personal  ability to learn and retain information.</p>



<h4>My Career Plan:</h4>
<p>Jacobs Ideal job was previously stated to be a video game developer, however after further research into the field of IT, the ideal job position evolved towards Specialist Software Engineer </p>
<p>I have made the choice towards pursuing software engineer as it was a more focused position within my original desired field of employment, game development. But specified itself to positions I felt I could enjoy and perform well.</p>
<p>A software engineers help in the construction and Development of computer system’s software and applications software, like performing modifications and maintenance the necessary software, usually through the use of at least one programming language they specialise in.</p>
<p>The necessary career path would start with my completion of a bachelor’s degree in information technology, and a bachelor’s degree in programming, with a specialisation in the C++ programming language, as well working in the employ of a junior software engineer position, then following with the natural progression path to software engineer and senior software engineer </p>

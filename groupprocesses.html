<h1>Group Processes</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>nuRecruITs communicated very well during Assignment 2. With strong, early leadership we set up communication platforms, and established a regular routine for video and chat communication. This proved to be the foundation to our completing the large volume of work and successful submission. We have ironed out a few issues such as missing webcams and negotiated the timing change around daylight savings (we have members on both the East and West coasts of Australia). </p>
<p>We could have delegated work more evenly in the early stages of Assignment 2, so we will try to improve communication around this. Members who are less shy in coming forward tend to grab all the work before quieter members are able to volunteer. We will address this by actively prompting quieter members for their input and being slower to allocate large chunks of work onto a few individuals.</p>
<p>Early on in assignment 2 there were a few communication issues surrounding the website and GitHub usage. We will aim to simplify our CSS so that all members can clearly understand how it interacts with each html page. This will give everyone confidence to contribute both html and CSS to the GitHub repository without fear of disrupting the overall design of the website.</p>
<p>Throughout the process of completing assignment 2 we kept discovering additional tasks and work expectations that were required. This was because we had not completed thorough individual and group examinations of the assignment description and marking rubric. This will be the focus of the first two meeting for Assignment 3, with all members expected to have read both documents and arrive at the meeting with clear ideas of how they would like to contribute and drive the project forward.</p>
<p>We will build on their strong foundation of communication during Assignment 2 to maximise efficiency and minimise stress and miscommunication. </p>
<p>We will continue our winning formula of twice weekly team meetings. These will have an agenda available prior to meeting commencement. They will be recorded, feature progress reports and check-ins, and summary notes will be provided afterwards.</p>
<p>An update to our meetings will be a standard procedure along with timelines. For instance, the chair of the meetings will spend a specified time addressing certain issues, such as new information about the assignment received during the week, deadline reminders, or addressing any communication or team issues that have arisen. Following this the meeting will progress around the group where each individual will give their own progress report, and update on any assistance they require or can offer. We will also create the idea of deliverables for each group member. </p>
<p>Another new feature we have implemented for Assignment 3 is the splitting of our group of 6 into 3 mini-groups. These groups will collaborate to work together on large sections of the assignment, and then report back with their progress and completed work to the main group. They will communicate via MS Teams text chats as well as 1-on-1 video calls to plan, collaborate and troubleshoot.</p>
